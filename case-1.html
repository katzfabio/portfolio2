  <b>RATIONALE:</b> Dineen pride themselves on the fact that they are built inside one of the oldest heritage buildings in Toronto while having a modern twist to the shop's branding. In order to maintain this aesthetic, I added a golden stamp effect to give the animation illustration a 1920 Art Deco feel." %}
