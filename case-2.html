  <b>CLIENT:</b> Joey Kidney - Stay you<br><br>

  <b>GOAL:</b> To create an intro for Joey kidney’s YouTube channel that translates his branding. His channel is about creating a safe place for teenagers to come listen to him speak about topics such as mental wellness and relationships.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> I emphasized Joey’s warm and caring personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. By giving white space to the animation, it creates the delicate tone that Joey was hopeing for and also creates a freindly feeling.
  I carried out the same hand drawn effect by having Joey’s name write on as if he himself was signing the video." %}

He wanted a intro for his youtube videos that was subtle, coherent with his branding, and inviting. I began by story boarding and creating a moodboard in order to show the cleint. Was this phase was approved I moved on to creat a style frame. Here the client was able to fully see what the outcome would be like. This then took me into the animation production and a third showing of the outcome to get approvel." %}
