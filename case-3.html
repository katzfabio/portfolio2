  <b>GOAL:</b>Create a motion piece that highlights my drive for learning and shows I know how to tell stories through motion, illustration while applying my experiences to tell them.<br><br>
  <b>RATIONALE:</b>The black and white photos represent my real life experiences. In fact each photo used in this motion piece was taken by me and then later manipulated through photoshop. I made the video have flow to hit the ques of the music, and to keep the audience captivated. The baby blue creates a calm tone to mimic the classical music." %}

I created styleframes to make sure I new what each scene would look like, this made it easy to later add transitions. The final step was adding any extra textures or details. " %}
