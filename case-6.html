  <b>RATIONALE:</b> The video demonstrates the demo of how the application would work. The flow always leads the user to the menu items to impliment the use of the AR feature. The purpose for using AR is to enhance the ice cream experience for customers while being at Magic Molecule." %}

I began to write down ideas for different unique experiences. This lead me to a website that had a list of the top ten technology experiences for 2019, one being AR. I realized that I could add this to the menu, which not only would enhance the experience but also be coherent with the new science and modern logo I re-designed for them. " %}
