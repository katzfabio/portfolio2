Ever since I was little I thought that peoples story's were linear. I thought it was as simple as saying "I want to be and astronaut" and boom, one day you are. It wasn't until I started modeling at 15 that I realized that my conception wasn't completely true. Story's are much more complex. Instead of a linear path, it's one giant ball of intertwining paths that lead into one.

I could tell you the full story of my life so far but I will spare you the pain of having to read a lot and just summarize why I do what I do.

Everything has a complex story waiting to be told and I want to tell them in a digestible and empathetic. I use my life experiences and my giant appetite for learning new techniques in order to captivate those stories through my Motion Design and illustrations.
