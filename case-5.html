  <b>GOAL:</b> The goal of this project was to create a social media video that when swiping through fastly will grab people's attention in order to shine light on the topic.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> I created this project to be 80's Retro feel because many legendry public service annoucments like, House Hippo, were created during that time. I acheived this by adding an off white background and the font at the end of the video to mimic trends in this era. The reason I didn't incorporate music is to make the laughter stand out  even more, and create a rawness to the video. The purpose of having the diffrent styled rotocoped styles is to represent diversity and the idea that it doesnt matter what background you come from, laughing is contagious to everyone. " %}
